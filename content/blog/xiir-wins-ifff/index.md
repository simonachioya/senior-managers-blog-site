We are continuing to capture some highlights of the Xiir start-up journey during our initial publications on medium.

Xiir won the recent Irish Funds Fintech Factor.

We definitely were both thrilled and honoured and why wouldn’t we be.

Our prize was a valuable booth at the Annual Global Irish Funds 2020 Conference, over two days on October 21st and 22nd.

The theme for 2020 conference was “Embracing New Perspectives” and the agenda contained thought-provoking content covering a number of key areas in the funds industry, including the response to Covid-19, the challenge of Brexit, sustainability and ESG, regulation, FinTech and AI, funds distribution, cybersecurity, and the future of work.

And how we got there.

We were in a highly competitive field with other innovative startups companies, so winning Fintech Factor was no way a certainty. We put in a huge amount of preparation work in advance of the event. And luckily this paid dividend.
