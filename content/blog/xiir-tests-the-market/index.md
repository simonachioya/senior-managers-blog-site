We are continuing to capture some highlights of the Xiir start-up journey during our initial publications on medium.

Xiir provided early demos at MoneyConf in the RDS, Dublin, Ireland.

Did you attend MoneyConf 2018?

We were amazingly surprised by the queues of financial professionals who charged the Xiir booth during breaks and over lunch.

With non-stop delivery of early stage demos the true direction of Xiir was incubated.

MoneyConf was devised by Paddy Cosgrave and his team who produce the Web Summit, the largest annual technology conference in the world.

> In 2018, over 5,000 of the top names in the industry, from CEOs of global institutions and brands 
> to the founders of the world’s most disruptive startups joined us at MoneyConf. MoneyConf has become 
> “Europe’s largest cryptocurrency and fintech event”, a crossroads for the world’s largest buyers and 
> sellers of technology, alongside many of the world’s most disruptive emerging fintech companies.

As a stand alone event the MoneyConf event has ended and now is scaling out within the Web Summit.

Below we illustrate a glimpse of our exhibition stand and how it resulted in the first Xiir PR success.

Xiir was in early concept stage at this point, but the in-person insight gained was invaluable for how the www.Xiir.com product has been shaped.
